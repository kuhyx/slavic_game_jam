## Project Overview
This is a labyrinth game built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The game features:

- Player navigation through a maze using keyboard controls
- Visual feedback for dangerous vs safe squares (different colors/patterns)
- Audio feedback using Web Audio API for dangerous areas
- Haptic vibration feedback on supported devices
- Canvas-based rendering for smooth graphics

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Implement modular code structure with separate files for game logic, rendering, and audio
- Use clear variable and function names that describe their purpose
- Add comments for complex game mechanics and algorithms

## Key Components
- Game engine with update/render loop
- Player movement and collision detection
- Maze generation or predefined layouts
- Audio system for sound effects
- Vibration API integration for haptic feedback
- Visual effects and animations for enhanced user experience
