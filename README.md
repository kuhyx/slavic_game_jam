- **Audio Feedback**: 
  - **Directional proximity warnings**: Spatial audio indicates direction of hidden dangers
    - **Left/Right**: Sound pans to the side where danger is located
    - **Up/Down**: Pitch changes (higher for above, lower for below)
    - **Multiple directions**: Combined audio cues for complex danger patterns
  - **Danger sounds**: When stepping on audio danger squares
  - **Victory melody**: When completing the maze
  - Built with Web Audio API with stereo panning and pitch modulation

- **Haptic Feedback**: 
  - **Game Over**: Strong vibration pattern when touching dangerous squares
  - **Victory**: Celebration vibration pattern when reaching the exit
  - Toggle on/off functionality

### Technical Features
- **HTML5 Canvas Rendering**: Smooth 60fps graphics
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features and modules
- **Open Field Design**: No maze walls, only boundary constraints

## Getting Started

## How to Play

1. **Movement**: Use WASD keys or arrow keys to move your character (green circle)
2. **Avoid All Dangers**: Both red squares and hidden audio dangers are **deadly**!
3. **Game Over**: Stepping on any dangerous square ends the game immediately
4. **Directional Audio Cues**: 
   - **Left/Right panning**: Sound comes from the side where hidden dangers are located
   - **Pitch variation**: Higher pitch for dangers above, lower pitch for dangers below
   - **Proximity warnings**: Listen carefully to avoid hidden dangers
5. **Open Navigation**: Move freely through the field - only the outer boundary blocks you
6. **Find the Exit**: Navigate to the green flag (üèÅ) to complete the level
7. **Challenge**: Complete the field without touching any dangerous squares!
8. **Headphone Recommended**: Use headphones or good speakers for optimal directional audio experience

## Game Controls

- **W / ‚Üë**: Move up
- **A / ‚Üê**: Move left  
- **S / ‚Üì**: Move down
- **D / ‚Üí**: Move right
- **Sound Toggle**: Enable/disable audio feedback
- **Vibration Toggle**: Enable/disable haptic feedback

## Technical Architecture

The game is built with a modular architecture:

- `game.js`: Main game loop and state management
- `player.js`: Player entity and rendering
- `maze.js`: Field generation and rendering
- `audio.js`: Sound effects and Web Audio API integration  
- `input.js`: Keyboard input handling
- `style.css`: Game styling and responsive design

## Browser Compatibility

- **Audio**: Requires Web Audio API support with stereo panning (all modern browsers)
- **Vibration**: Requires Vibration API support (mobile browsers, some desktop)
- **Graphics**: HTML5 Canvas support (all modern browsers)
- **Directional Audio**: Best experienced with headphones or stereo speakers
